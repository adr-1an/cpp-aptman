cpp-aptman is a simplified version of the apt package manager made for Linux systems.
I tried making the app look as close to a GUI as possible, but also keeping Linux's terminal style.
--- HOW TO USE ---
Download the "a.out" file, and run it- " ./a.out ".
It's recommended to run it as root, to not get prompted for your password later on.
--- SUPPORTED SYSTEMS ---
Basically any system that uses apt.
